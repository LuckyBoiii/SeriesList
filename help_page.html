                    Here you can see the list settings. This help page will go over what they do one by one. <br> <br>
                    The first thing you can change is the page title, by clicking and then typing in. The title will be saved but you can change it
                    whenever by clicking and typing again. It is currently marked on the page as "Place your list title here!" <br> <br>
                    Next is the title of your new item. This you write in the "Write your title here!" area.
                    Your title can be as long as you want, but will not be displayed if it goes outside the screen. Every title is editable even
                    after adding the item to your list. <br> <br>
                    Next up is the "Series" and "Other" checkboxes. If you check a box your item will be marked as either a series or other.
                    This is useful for quickly looking through your list and seeing if you item is a series which you can watch or something else.
                    If you don't check a box it will be marked as "Series" by default. After adding the item there is no way to change from "Series" 
                    to "Other".<br> <br>
                    Last but not least is the "Add" button. This button will add your item to the list. If you have not written anything in the title
                    it will add an item with a blank title. Added items are put at the bottom of the list.
                </p>

                    Next up is the item settings. This help page will go over what they do one by one. <br> <br>
                    The first thing you can change is the title of your item. First press the "Edit" button and then you can change the title by typing
                    just like normal. When you are done press anywhere outside the item and your new title will be saved! <br> <br>
                    And then there is the "Delete" button. This button will delete your item from the list. A deleted item can not be recovered.
